# Prompt-Forge

Prompt-Forge is an open-source tool designed for researchers, penetration testers, and ethical hackers to iteratively modify, construct, and evolve prompt injection attacks. It leverages the structured techniques and taxonomies from the Arc PI Taxonomy to facilitate the development and testing of adversarial prompts against AI systems.

## Features

- **Interactive Prompt Builder**: Step-by-step construction of prompt injection attacks using categorized techniques (intents, methods, evasions).
- **Taxonomy Integration**: Built on the Arc PI Taxonomy for comprehensive coverage of attack vectors.
- **Iterative Evolution**: Tools to refine and mutate prompts based on feedback and testing results.
- **Ethical Use Only**: Intended solely for security research and defensive purposes.
